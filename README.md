Start locally
1. Copy repo
Fork / Download this repository so you have the files locally.

2. Install all dependencies
Make sure you have installed all necessary dependencies with npm run install

3. Start the development server
Start the development server with npm run dev. Please note that some features, like the letter stack of the community won't work as it fetches necessary data over a Vercel API endpoint.

An active wifi connection is required as some features like localization might not work without.

Contributing
You are free to contribute to the project whether by opening Issues or by forking this repo and opening a PR. I appreciate any help and feedback – please don't be angry if I'm not going to implement your feedback. It is most likely because I've decided to do something on porpuse.
