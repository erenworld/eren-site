My minimalist site.

<h1>This project.</h1> 

I'm a design engineer. That means, I'm both a creative and a logical thinker trying to combine both skills in one job.

1. Copy repo
Fork / Download this repository so you have the files locally.

2. Install all dependencies
Make sure you have installed all necessary dependencies with npm run install

3. Start the development server
